excerpt: |
  <p>
  a dip in cold water after days in the rough looking directly at the sun new days new ways to think about the same old things bugging me i wait for the chill to take over again and again
  </p>
  <p>
  that blues song in my head ever changing ocean breeze and clarity objects of my hunger as somewhere on river street a mime mesmerizes strangers looking for the void they misplaced looks on their faces telling life stories
  </p>
  <p>
  a lottery window in the middle of poverty seems right somehow i forgot what it was like to be cold and hungry luck like ours is hard to come by days turning into night unfulfilled
  </p>
  <p>
  but wait i see now that i was mistaken the roads wind on but there's no cars now polluted alternatives to lost causes
  </p>
  <p>
  i remain... wondering
