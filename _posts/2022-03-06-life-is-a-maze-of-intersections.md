In August of 2001, we lived in Aurora, Illinois. Kim’s new job required frequent travel between the Chicago and Detroit Areas. A week-at-a-time being apart was a new challenge. Lovebirds never like leaving the cage.

In my mind, the airport represented an intersection – one that not only led to us being apart but also led to our being together again. The latter, when we converged again was the best part. Intersections took on new meanings in my mind. The airport was special to me  then and for years to follow.

So. That’s a little bit of the story behind my old <a href="https://jenett.org/intersect/">intersect</a> project. Thanks to the <a href="gossipsweb.net/">guy</a> who recently asked me about the project. I always appreciate feedback.
