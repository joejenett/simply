<p>My buddy <a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/">John</a> is now back to school as a teacher in Scotland. His <a title="Back to School Tomorrow  Back to School Tomorrow" href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/back-to-school-tomorrow/"><em>summer redux</em></a> includes a wonderful video collage of <em>summer photos</em> - done quite well to music by <a title="incompetech – Music and also Graph Paper" href="https://incompetech.com/">Kevin MacLeod</a>. Nice.
</p>
<p>
Then I discovered something on the sidebar (gawd, I love when that happens) - John’s got <a title="106 drop in - it even has Wiggle Gifs!" href="https://johnjohnston.info/106/">another blog</a>  “where stranger things happen" - who knew?
