<p>My buddy <a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/">John</a> is now back to school as a teacher in Scotland. His <a title="Back to School Tomorrow  Back to School Tomorrow" href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/back-to-school-tomorrow/"><em>summer redux</em></a> includes a wonderful video collage of <em>summer photos</em> - done quite well to music by <a title="incompetech â€“ Music and also Graph Paper" href="https://incompetech.com/">Kevin MacLeod</a>. Nice.

Then I discovered something on the sidebar (gawd, I love when that happens) - Johnâ€™s got <a title="106 drop in - it even has Wiggle Gifs!" href="https://johnjohnston.info/106/">another blog</a>  â€œwhere stranger things happen" - who knew?

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:.8rem;">Thanks for the love Joe,<br />
Just when I think Iâ€™ll get rid of the sidebar. They do seem to have gone out of fashion. I guess Iâ€™ll keep mine till they come back inðŸ˜‰

<p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:.8rem;"><a href="http://ds106.us/">Ds106</a>, was/is a wonderful course on â€˜digital storytellingâ€™ that has run in several universities but allows anyone to join in. A source of a lot of fun and a lot of learning about owning your own space.
