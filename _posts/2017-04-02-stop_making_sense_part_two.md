  <p>
  believe it or not i know what it's like to think i'm the center of the universe but i'm not nor are you the ill-conceived notion that lucky breaks are somehow deserved
  </p>
  <p>
  so i became you a loser in waiting for better things and you are now me just another loser and we all find our way in different ways and days go by empty dreams falling away in waiting for better things
  </p>
  <p>
  i just hope the children learn something...
