Just this morning, a nudge from a [pinboard friend](https://pinboard.in/u:ramblinggit) reminds me of a familiar netizen’s [projects](https://m15o.ichi.city/site/projects.html), particularly [Status Cafe](https://status.cafe/). I just gots to explore it again!  

Damn, [this](https://status.cafe/users/biko) seems awfully familiar to me. Oh yeah. I shared [his garden](https://bikobatanari.art/garden.html) at the wiki - in fact, I had to create a [delightful.finds](https://wiki.jenett.org/delightful.finds:04-10-21) category for it. It was fun then and it’s fun again now! Then I check out [another user](https://status.cafe/users/forest):
>gotta remind myself, every day, that i dont HAVE to fully render my art. i can just doodle. i can just sketch. dont touch that paintbrush  

Yes, I need to see more. So I check out [his site](https://swiftyshq.neocities.org/) - bang! Got me a new pointer, thank you.
## and the point is
The fun I had this morning is exactly what I’m hoping my sites’ visitors will experience when they explore the links I share. A little attention goes a long way - take some time to explore... and enjoy!
