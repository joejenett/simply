A parody if you will:

<blockquote>
<p>
Talking to myself (ah, oh, oh-oh)<br>
Talking to myself (ah, oh, oh-oh)<br>
When there's nothing to lose and there's nothing to prove<br>
Well, I'm talking to myself, ah, oh, oh-oh
</p>
</blockquote>

Sorry Billy!

My whacked creativity tends to talk to me directly at times. I give myself a lot of advice, sometimes in the form of <a href="https://simply.joejenett.com/4045/">words</a>, other times in the form of <a href="https://simply.joejenett.com/love-waitin-for-ya-take-one/">music</a>. I guess I’m a bit narcissistic that way. Like the way I’m linking to myself here - eeeew!
</p>
<p>
Okay Joe, let’s stop this right now!
</p>
<p>Carry on...
