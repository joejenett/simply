  <p>So. This post was originally a tribute to Mr. Joe Cocker, in which I embedded a video of one of the most amazing performances by any artist in recent times. Unfortunately, the video was later deleted from Vimeo, which resulted in a <i>not found</i> message replacing the embedded video. So, I'll just say that Joe Cocker was one of my very favorites and he will be missed but <i>I'll get by with a little help from my friends</i>. R.I.P. Joe.</p>
  <p>
  And to my friends, I say Happy Holidays to you and yours!

So. This post was originally a tribute to Mr. Joe Cocker, in which I embedded a video of one of the most amazing performances by any artist in recent times. Unfortunately, the video was later deleted from Vimeo, which resulted in a _not found_ message replacing the embedded video. So, I’ll just say that Joe Cocker was one of my very favorites and he will be missed but _I’ll get by with a little help from my friends_. R.I.P. Joe.

And to my friends, I say Happy Holidays to you and yours!
