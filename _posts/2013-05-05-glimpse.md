  A girl in her late teens looks into her closet,  which seems to hold no less than a hundred outfits. "I have nothing to wear!" Mom stands in the corner of the room. "I wish I was dead. I wish you were dead."

A girl in her late teens looks into her closet, which seems to hold no less than a hundred outfits. &#8220;I have nothing to wear!&#8221; Mom stands in the corner of the room. &#8220;I wish I was dead. I wish you were dead.&#8221; 

The girl standing at the ironing board unplugs the iron and throws it at Mom, just missing. Mom lunges at her screaming &#8220;I hate you, I hate you!&#8221; 

For a ten-year-old, impressions like these form memories not easily forgotten. Further down the road, long gone moments like these surface yet again craving clarity.
