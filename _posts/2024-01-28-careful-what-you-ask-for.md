Smarts homes and digital assistants are great but one needs to stay a step ahead of ’em.

Back when I got real sick a few months ago, I was bedridden at home for 8 days before finally deciding to go to the ER. I doubt I would have survived those days at home had it not been for my wife Kim who was always there for me. We stayed in touch with messages and everything I needed appeared in a flash. She is kinda amazing, thank you.

So. One late evening, I used Siri to tell Kim “help” (not an odd request in context). A short while thereafter, the doorbell rang several times. It was the police.

## how could this happen? 
When I gave the _hey Siri_, it was picked up by a new HomePod, recently purchased to use as a hub for Matter accessories. At the time, I replaced 4 outlets requiring the new format. I failed to take into account the fact that the HomePod provides only spoken confirmations. Turns out I heard the confirmation just as poorly as Siri heard my command. Oops! My bad!

So a neighbor of ours named Ken got the help message and rightfully called the police because he was concerned that it could be a genuine request (though he thought it was most likely some kind of error). I later told him how much I appreciated that he cared enough to do that. Good neighbor.

## and what did joe learn? 
 If Siri turns off the wrong light, so what! When Siri sends an important message to the wrong person though, that’s a biggie. Though Kim convinced the police that everything was okay, it could have gone much differently.
 
 It didn’t take long to figure out how it happened and what I needed to do to prevent such a thing in the future. 
 
 New rule - disable _personal requests_ on devices that provide spoken confirmations only. Done.
