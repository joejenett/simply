  <p>Mankind is evolving. Society is evolving. You can't stop running water even if you're the greatest thing since the wheel (in your own mind, anyway). </p>
  <p>Years of progress can't be erased but your determination to try (on behalf of the so-called American people that put you here) is, as you might put it, <em>very, very</em> aggravating. On a daily basis. </p>
  <p>You're a thorn on the world's butt Donald Trump and you're smart enough to know it. <em>Believe me!</em></p>

Mankind is evolving. Society is evolving. You can’t stop running water even if you’re the greatest thing since the wheel (in your own mind, anyway). 

Years of progress can’t be erased but your determination to try (on behalf of the so-called American people that put you here) is, as you might put it, _very, very_ aggravating. On a daily basis. 

You’re a thorn on the world’s butt Donald Trump and you’re smart enough to know it. _Believe me!_
