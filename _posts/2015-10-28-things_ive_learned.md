excerpt: |
  My good friend Anne once ended a blog post with the question, “Anything you’ve learned from life so far you’d care to pass along?” That was a long time ago but I’ve finally gathered just a few answers:
  <ul>
  <li>It’s much easier to give advice than to take it.</li>
  <li>There’s no shortage of crazy in the world.</li>
  <li>When someone starts with “I’m not a racist but," they probably are.</li>
  <li>Texting while driving is just as dangerous as driving drunk, which is pretty f*ing dangerous!</li>
  <li>Gun lobbyists are dangerous to all of us as well.</li>
  </ul>
  Then again, what do I know?

My good friend Anne once ended a blog post with the question, “Anything you’ve learned from life so far you’d care to pass along?” That was a long time ago but I’ve finally gathered just a few answers:

  * It’s much easier to give advice than to take it.
  * There’s no shortage of crazy in the world.
  * When someone starts with “I’m not a racist but,&#8221; they probably are.
  * Texting while driving is just as dangerous as driving drunk, which is pretty f*ing dangerous!
  * Gun lobbyists are dangerous to all of us as well.
