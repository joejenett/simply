Over the last month, I’ve been working on the resurrection of <em>bulltown</em>. It’s a <a href="https://bulltown.2022.jenett.org/">new take</a> on content from the <em>bulltown</em> archives, circa 1997-2004 inspired by so many sites I’ve encountered recently full of the retro style and spirit of the web of the late 1990s. I have a new appreciation for that content in terms of where my head was at back then - in a sense, it helps me understand who I am now. It’s been a gratifying experience. 
</p>
<p>
I’ve done away with the frames, tables, and pop-up windows ending up with a quieter and more minimal presentation.

You may have noticed that some of its content is <a href="https://simply.jenett.org/categories/#redux">republished</a> on this blog. Moving forward, I hope to create more content in that same spirit to be added to the new <em>bulltown</em>. I hope you enjoy it.
