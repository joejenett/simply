excerpt: |
  <p>
  I savor the sounds of an orchestra in a memory of an ocean far away. She and I both loved that place. Life is full of missed experiences and experiences we miss (two different things). Change can be both a problem and a solution.

  <p>
  The wind sings as the sun hits your forehead and you become transformed. What seemed so hopeless a moment ago becomes a new dream. Victims become survivors. Disappointments become new hopes. We can become something new, refreshed...
