  <p>
  so magnificent<br />
  those rare beings that shape us<br />
  and then go away
  </p>
  <p>
  i stop to wonder<br />
  what is this thing we call life<br />
  and why so fragile?
  </p>
  <p>
  maybe the truth is<br />
  we are not meant to see through<br />
  spiritual things
  </p>
  <p>
  nothing so sad as<br />
  presence becoming absence<br />
  in just a moment
  </p>
  <p>
  maybe the truth is<br />
  we were never designed to<br />
  really understand
