excerpt: |
  What seemed like a simple intersection at first became more complicated than we could ever imagine. That right turn many Americans decided to take was a wrong turn, landing a <i>big pile of crazy</i> in the White House. Yeah, we all make mistakes but there's really no excuse for <i>deplorable</i>. How can one ‘make America great’ when he personifies exactly what's wrong with America?

What seemed like a simple intersection at first became more complicated than we could ever imagine. That right turn many Americans decided to take was a wrong turn, landing a _big pile of crazy_ in the White House. Yeah, we all make mistakes but there’s really no excuse for _deplorable_. How can one ‘make America great’ when he personifies exactly what’s wrong with America?
