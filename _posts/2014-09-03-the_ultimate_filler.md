  So, I'm thinking to myself that I gotta get that political content off the front page but while I'm juggling a number of other things at the moment, what can I do other than resorting to that “page intentionally blank” trick? Why, <a title="bouncing kitties" href="http://cat-bounce.com/">bouncing kitties</a> is just the ticket, dontcha think? They even have a <a title="mobile version" href="http://cat-bounce.com/mobile/">mobile version</a> that doesn't need Flash.
