It’s early September, 2001 and there’s something new on the web - pop-under ads. 

I’m sorry but when I hear _Yahoo!_ or _GeoCities_, especially in the same sentence, my first thought is pop-under ads. They made me so angry back then, I created an initiative to take a stand against them.

The thing about the web is you can stake out a little place of your own - a place for expressing yourself (whatever that means to you) - a place you can call home - a place from which you might say your piece.

NeoCities is not ‘Yahoo! GeoCities’... it’s much better, thank you!
