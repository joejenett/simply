&#8220;If we wait, we might get to see him.&#8221;

&#8220;Do you really think so? He may not want to see us.&#8221;

The waiting game’s not easy, but he had done it his whole life and now it was his time for payback. The fool followed fame as he pretended to be something bigger than life (as he waited to actually be bigger than life). After pretending he had arrived for so long, he actually convinced himself that he had arrived.

&#8220;Do you think he’ll recognize us?&#8221;

She had a strange look in her eyes as she asked the question. She remembered how he treated her before she left. She wondered why she was interested in him at all.

&#8220;Hey, baby! Long time.&#8221;

&#8220;Not long enough.&#8221;

&#8220;I told you!&#8221;

&#8220;I know, Mother.&#8221;
