I remember chuckling when I saw the tagline at [groupmeh](http://groupmeh.com/) a few months back &ndash; &#8220;a revolutionary, game-changing social network for the tragically apathetic&#8221; &ndash; didn’t really look further at the time but saved the link (as I usually do when something strange gets my attention). Anyway, I visited the link again early this morning and noticed that nothing had really changed. My guess was that I would have to press the &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button if I wanted to see more than its landing page.

So, I do and the form below appears on the page. Within a few seconds, I’m laughing loudly and MoJo is looking at me like I’m totally nuts or something (he’s a very observant kitty). I think to myself that I’m not &#8220;really desperate&#8221; enough to go any further. I’m also wondering if people are actually filling in this thing and giving reasons for wanting to join. I’m asking myself, &#8220;How many really desperate people are out there?&#8221; and decide to _google_ it. That’s right, it’s a verb, dammit!

What I found is not only a [background article](http://www.barbariangroup.com/posts/7980-groupmeh_com_from_inside_joke_to_internet_sensation) but also, the prize: all those submitted [reasons](http://groupmeh.com/reasons.php). What a delightful morning this has been!
