<p style="font-size:.8em;">When you can't remember where you come from<br>
And you can't recover from the pain<br>
Take a look around you, let your life astound you<br>
When your soul has found you, you'll be fine again
</p>
<p style="font-size:.8em;">
So easy to forget all the spirit<br>
That you felt before the tables turned on you<br>
But a fire burns deep inside a broken heart that tries to hide<br>
And when the pain subsides, you'll know just what to do
</p>
<p style="font-size:.8em;">
Hold on to your soul, it's everything you know<br>
Be true to your soul to find the answer<br>
It's all in your soul, the thing that makes you whole<br>
And carries you home, it's alright...
</p>
