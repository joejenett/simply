Playing with graphics is kinda like music to me. It’s a creative outlet that takes my mind to a different place - a perfect distraction!

Well. A few weeks back, I simplified my desktop and love it. I spend hours daily looking at my screens and this minimal b&amp;w look on the main screen suits me well:

<p>The icons for Apple’s built-in apps are tucked away in an easy-to-activate palette as changing those icons appears to be disallowed by the operating system. Though activating the palette brings a temporary burst of color to the desktop which looks nice against the b&amp;w, I find myself quickly closing it to maintain the minimal feel (which makes me happy).</p>

Cheers and thanks for visiting!
