[@kicks](https://micro.blog/kicks) - just an fyi - I pinged your reply article again (with the iwebthings post permalink) as an additional test for webmentions sent from iwebthings.

<p>This makes sense. I want to expand further on the purpose of certain kinds of
linking—partially in response to Chris Aldrich’s <a href="https://boffosocko.com/2018/12/19/the-web-finally-feels-new-again-kickscondor/" rel="nofollow ugc">addition</a> to our conversation. Hopefully I’ll make time this weekend.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions in detail. It’s been a great help to me to watch you work. Your sites are looking and functioning well—and the links you are passing out are of exceptional quality.</p>
