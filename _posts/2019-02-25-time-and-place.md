So this lady’s at our house a few weeks before Christmas and we’re talking. The conversation turns to her partner needing some rare medication that’s easier to get in Mexico. “We’re not sure about going to Mexico,” she says. “Okay, I know it’s a Trump thing and all but those caravan people are there.” Whoa!

Apparently _those people_ aren’t really people. They’re like monsters getting ready to invade our country and rape our children. That’s the crap Donald’s been feeding people and millions are eating it up. Our country’s in a bit of a mess right now. I regret I was speechless at the time.

Saying more about that now just adds to the noise, so let’s move on. My mind swirled a bit when I first read this at Anne’s place and I’m still thinkin’ about it:

<blockquote style="margin-right:36px;line-height:1.1em;">
  <p>
    “Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.”
  </p>
  
  <div style="text-align: right; margin-top: 8px 8px 0 0; font-size: 13px;">
    - Terry Pratchett
  </div>
</blockquote>

From Colorado to Delaware to Florida to Illinois to Michigan. All the stops in one’s journey define who they are and going back to where one started is just a visit to another new, though familiar place.

Some stops in the journey border on unbearable but a new world is always just around the corner and when we’re lucky, it’s a better place.

<p>I was just watching Cohen and the hearing, listening to republican members do their best mini-trump spewing and distracting. To think i’d live long enough to watch elected officials deliberately, happily support the destruction of democracy in America, is heartbreaking. It’s happened before in small ways here and there, but never before so publicly and in such unimaginable ways.</p>
<p>Yes, unbearable. But also yes, there are better moments, better places. Thank you.</p></div></article></li></ol>
