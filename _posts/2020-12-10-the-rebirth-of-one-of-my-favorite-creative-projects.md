A project I launched in 2001 has always been special to me. There were 21 other creative contributors - I accepted new content submissions through the end of 2002. The site‚Äôs been sitting there since. The original site used Flash and presented content in popup windows, both of which were reasons for my not linking to it in more recent years.

The good news is I just completed the first step of resigning it. No more Flash or popups - just the same content in a better place. I invite you to explore the new version of [intersect](https://jenett.org/intersect/ "intersect") - hope you like it. üòé
