<p>In a recent <a href="/you-gotta-love-this-guy/">post</a> about my buddy <a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/">John</a>, I pointed out ‘something really special’ I found on his blog’s sidebar. Why was it special? It was fun and who doesn’t need a little fun these days!</p>
<p>John often writes about <a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/tag/wordpress/">Wordpress</a> (and <a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/tag/blogging/">blogging</a> in general). I have no doubt John was having fun with this <a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/blocks-css/">little demo</a> he made, most likely intended to inspire his students. What’s funny about this is I never use(d) the block editor and dammit, he might have inspired me too: </p>
<blockquote><p>
I am still not all in on using blocks, but this could be fun.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Say it again - you gotta love this guy!</p>
