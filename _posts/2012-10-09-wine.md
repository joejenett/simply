  just you and me now
  remembering how it was
  never lost with time
  
  everything's changed
  so different now, so strange
  love lives in the mind
  
  we found a flower
  dying in the morning sun
  turned it into wine

just you and me now  
remembering how it was  
never lost with time

everythingâ€™s changed  
so different now, so strange  
love lives in the mind

we found a flower  
dying in the morning sun  
turned it into wine
