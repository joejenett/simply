summary: it’s never too late...

Sometimes, when we’re just hanging out having fun, I’ll tell Kim, “I need you to add something to my urn.” 

Like ‘he sure could make a sub!’ or ‘he was a friggin’ genius!’ Sure. I care about my legacy especially at my age. 

Nope. Ain’t telling. I never suggested she add ‘damn! he was really, really old!’ to my urn. 😎

My upbringing was full of shouting and sometimes violent fighting around me. Needless to say, it took a long time for me to grow up and out of the chaos. What I had so abhorred eventually helped me understand myself better. 

I guess my own need to be happy helped me understand the value of making others happy.  From deep within my soul, I see myself as an entertainer of sorts.

If something I share gives one person a moment of joy (or at least a thought provoking idea to ponder over), then I’ve made a little difference in the world. I live for that…

A crappy upbringing ain’t the whole story. Add Neil Young, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and David Bowie to the list of people/things which impacted my life in huge ways. You can also add computers, the internet, and the power of hypertext and web building while you’re at it.

Of everything above, I’d have to say David Bowie inspired me in the biggest way. When he died, I was just a few years younger than him.

Knowing his demise was imminent, he managed to complete his greatest work (imo) - ‘Blackstar’ was released just 2 days before his death.

He taught me it’s never too late to live out one’s dreams and visions... until it’s too late. I live by that.

Read between my lines - hopefully, you’ll understand the sense of fulfillment I’m lucky to enjoy.
