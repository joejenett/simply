  When you get down to it, there's little you know about me though I've been hanging around here in public for a long time now &ndash; you only know what I've chosen to tell you about me (plus what you might have figured out on your own). I've simply got to tell you more. With that said, here's a song I really like, not only for the music but also for the clues it might provide as to who I am (if you don't take it too literally, that is). Enjoy!
