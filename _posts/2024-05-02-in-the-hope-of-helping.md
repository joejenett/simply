lose your soul<br>   
you’ll lose your mind

It’s early March. A sister and daughter head out to be with her. Things were touch and go and the prognosis was bleak. Times come when one reaches the stage of having lost what a life even feels like. Sometimes the worst that can happen is a blessed load off. Sad. But the hope of becoming at peace with it has to be enough for now.

<blockquote>
<p>
time to remember<br>
things you shared over the years<br>
hold on to the joy
</p>
</blockquote>

It’s May now. I watch them carry the pain quietly in their hearts. Grateful to know life goes on...
