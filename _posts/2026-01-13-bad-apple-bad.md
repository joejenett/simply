I find it hard to believe that Apple is programmatically nagging users to update to Tahoe (despite compatibility issues) without giving users the choice to say no.

Some time ago, I learned the hard way that Tahoe won’t even boot on my 2020 iMac (Intel). And I can't get back the huge amount of time consumed in recovering my machine. Back then I chose to do the update, but currently, many users with Automatic Updates turned on are learning the same lesson.

Why doesn’t Apple know about these compatibility issues? What in hell happened to them?

As a long-time customer, this is incredible to me.  

Thanks for listening.
