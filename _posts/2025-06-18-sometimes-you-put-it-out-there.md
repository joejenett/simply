...and sometimes you should take it back.

That feeling when I publicly put something out there and come to realize it could be taken as something entirely different than what I intended to say.

Iâ€™m thankful a part of my routine is to read everything I write a second time after at least a few hours. Everything I do is a work in progress and mistakes are just another part of the routine.

Now you know why I feel free to edit what I write. Writing like coding, always has room to improve.

Cheers,  
joe
