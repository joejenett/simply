Thanks to the miracles of modern medicine and therapeutic botanicals, I’m grateful to report this old guy is doing just fine. Seems there’s still time for my [_bowie moment_](https://simply.joejenett.com/bowie/). 

### 73 ain’t nothing to me.

Recently, mainstream news media covered one story for over 2 weeks as if there was nothing else going on in the world. 

The story was about age, covering what seemed an ugly, public display of elder abuse. It made me realize how clueless people can be about age. 

Never take for granted the power of a competent, experienced mind!

### 81 goes back to day one.  

As certain abilities diminish over time, the mind takes up the slack. I’ve learned first hand to focus on what *I can do*, not what I can’t - it’s a key to surviving... in my mind.
