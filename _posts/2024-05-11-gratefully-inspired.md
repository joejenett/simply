I learned something from my old web pal Anne (a *curator of imagination*). It’s not the camera that makes the photographer. She was right.

For me, the magic of photography is one’s ability to capture what <strong>they see</strong> in the now. That was my first thought when I saw Winnie’s <a href="https://winnielim.org/notes/pink/">pink</a> this morning. Then I found John’s <a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/greenside/">Greenside</a> photos. He’s got an eye too.

Okay, so I’m supposed to be makin’ the donuts now. But some people visited this morning, like Winnie and John, have left me inspired. There were two more I planned to visit and wouldn’t you know, they left me even more inspired! 

I need more mornings like this one, thank you very much.

I see so many neat personal websites, I need to remind myself to take some time out and sign more guestbooks in appreciation and support.

And then I found Lonita’s <a href="https://lonita.net/creative">long list of random creative things to do with your time.</a>

I’m good.
