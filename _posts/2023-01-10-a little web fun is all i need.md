<p>It all started with John’s post, <a title="2022 in Titles  2022 in Titles – John's World Wide Wall Display" href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/2022-in-titles/#comments">2022 in Titles</a>. I’ve always been a sucker for word clouds and the one John made is cool! Thankfully, he shared a link to the <a href="https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/" title="WordCloud for Python">python command line word cloud generator</a> he used.</p>
<p>Not only do I appreciate him handing me a wonderful resource to use at the linkport but more importantly, he inspired me to tinker with the generator a bit. In the end, he inspired a brand new haiku and I kinda like it (see below). And that’s how ideas evolve...</p>
