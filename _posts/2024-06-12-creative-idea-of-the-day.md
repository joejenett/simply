In his late teens, he would sometimes travel from school in Gainesville to home in Miami Beach for the weekend. His BMW had a faring and windshield and was great for the 6-hour trip. He loved that bike!

Sleep-deprived, he headed out one Friday night and ended up falling asleep ‘at the wheel.’

When he came to, he was coasting through a row of trees and regained control.
