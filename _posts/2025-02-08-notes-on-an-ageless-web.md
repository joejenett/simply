(edited 02/12/25 for clarity)
</p>Several recent guestbook posts at [bulltown](https://bulltown.joejenett.com/) got my attention.
<blockquote><p>wowo cool site üòÅ</p></blockquote>
followed by
<blockquote><p>holy shit you're older than my dad</p></blockquote>
Hysterical laughter ensued! 

In all seriousness, it reminded me that the web is ageless and those thoughts could only have been written by someone as extremely young as I am old. As it turns out, the words came from a 14-year-old. 

We now follow each other at Neocities. She‚Äôs a nice person and her creativity is exactly the type of thing that made me [wanna join](https://bulltown.neocities.org/) Neocities in the first place. 
## so what does ‚Äòageless‚Äô mean anyway? 
Long ago in the age of Web 1.0, blogging, Geocities, Yahoo, and pop-under ads, I set out to make a point, creating <em>the ageless project</em>. Unfortunately, [all that remains](https://joejenett.com/ageless) is a list of links to about 5 dozen kind people who supported the project, linking to it from their own blog or personal homepage - there once was a large directory of links (not only to supporters) organized by the authors‚Äô ages - but link-checking (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">and fixing</span>) took its toll... 

When I first launched the project, many people wrote about it as if it was a directory of old peoples‚Äô personal sites. Not at all - it was a directory of personal sites authored by people of all ages - from teenagers to people in their nineties. I truly believed back then as I do now, that the web brings us all together regardless of age (and gender, ethnicity, or sexual identity)! 

With all that said, I have to admit I might very well be the oldest person in the Neocities community. Maybe not. 

<strong><em>But I love it!</em></strong>
