I’ve often said *life is good* to express my gratitude for being alive. I’ve been kinda lucky (but not always). 

Being wakened by pain doesn’t sit well with me. Nothing like interrupted sleep to make one feel like crap for the rest of a new day.

I’ve lived with chronic back problems for about 20 years and the related muscle spasms have increased in frequency and intensity over time. Only recently, some spasms have turned into painful leg cramps while I’m sleeping - that’s when joe says *let’s get up!*

There’s other health issues to manage too, some of which I’m simply stuck with but one of which I brought on myself and could probably fix if and when I finally get my shit together - makes the spasms seem like a walk in the park (no pun intended).

So I’m trying to work on it - apparently not hard enough... yet.
