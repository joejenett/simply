I <a href="https://iwebthings.joejenett.com/exploring-something-cool-05-19-24/">recently shared</a> a ‘plain text note-taking assistant’ at the <em>hub</em> and decided to give Jack a heads-up before publishing the post - if for no other reason, it was a chance to razz him a bit (yet again):

The thing about Jack is he tinkers with software and talks about it a lot. His sarcastic sense of humor sits well with me. I tinker with software too (a lot). I can relate - in fact, sometimes I wonder if he’s a mini-me...

I do the same damn things all the time, though with some different softwares. But that doesn’t stop me from saying I just pulled a Jack. After all, it sounds better than ‘pulled a Joe’ - <em>and</em> it’s more fun!

By the way Jack, I like <a href="https://yakitrak.github.io/obs/">Obsidian CLI</a> much better than the ‘assistant’ I shared that day...
