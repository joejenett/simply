<p>From <a  href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2022/08/18/i-wish-there.html">Amit</a>:  “I wish there was a technology that could capture the smell you are experiencing...” </p>
<p>📺 From <a href="https://alongtheray.com/">Ray</a>: “...think of total silence as an auditory experience of a different kind” when roaming around <a href="https://alongtheray.com/%F0%9F%93%BA-wander-tube-needles-overlook-moab-utah"> Utah</a> or <a href="https://alongtheray.com/wander-%F0%9F%93%BA-tube-montville-nature-loop-trail-mosca-co">Colorado</a>. I did and it was. Sweet!</p>
<p>Finally, from <a href="https://ramblinggit.com/2022/08/16/im-ordering-microwaveable.html">Brad</a> who just may have a future in stand-up: “...I’m keeping all the Darkness in the World at bay with beans.” You cracked me up Brad though I’m still trying to wrap my head around that <a title="Brad Enslen" href="https://ramblinggit.com/2022/08/19/heres-the-deal.html">dollar store</a> thing. 😎</p>
Later.
