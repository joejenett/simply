  <p>“A ridiculous but amusing person.” I have a decent information system in place and it tells me that <i>buffoon</i> fits that definition. While recent politics have been most entertaining, I'm sorry to report that <i>ridiculous</i> is anything but presidential. </p>
  <p>To those who chose to put Trump in the White House, your voices have been heard. Each of us is free to choose and I respect your right to your opinion. There's you and me. Us and them. Black and white. Red and blue. We're divided and we definitely disagree and though you win this time, the entertainment will surely continue as we all discover how your choice works out for you. </p>
  <p>Real leaders are hard to find. </p>
  <p>Shysters come easy, especially when they say what you're dying to hear, but their actions provide a whole different story (if you're paying attention). </p>

“A ridiculous but amusing person.” I have a decent information system in place and it tells me that _buffoon_ fits that definition. While recent politics have been most entertaining, I’m sorry to report that _ridiculous_ is anything but presidential. 

To those who chose to put Trump in the White House, your voices have been heard. Each of us is free to choose and I respect your right to your opinion. There’s you and me. Us and them. Black and white. Red and blue. We’re divided and we definitely disagree and though you win this time, the entertainment will surely continue as we all discover how your choice works out for you. 

Real leaders are hard to find. 

Shysters come easy, especially when they say what you’re dying to hear, but their actions provide a whole different story (if you’re paying attention).
