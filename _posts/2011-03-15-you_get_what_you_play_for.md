  <p>I've nothing to sell you here. You won't suddenly encounter ads at some point in time after I've gained your attention and there is no book forthcoming (at least not one with a price). My motivation here is different than all that. I'm not typical and you're not a target.
  </p><p>
  Recently, one's apparent interest in knowing more about my significant other quickly turned into a sales pitch and a request for her office phone number. Some people seem unable to let go of their business goals in social settings where others are simply trying to be sociable. I have things to sell too, but that doesn't mean I don't know when it's an inappropriate time or locale for peddling. Not here, not now, not ever, thank you.
