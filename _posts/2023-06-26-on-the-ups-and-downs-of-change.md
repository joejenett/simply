<p>I planted a <a href="https://ideas.joejenett.com/#new%20direction">seed</a> recently about a recent <a href="https://dwt-archives.joejenett.com/announcement/"><em>game changer</em> </a> in my life - making the difficult decision to retire <em>the dailywebthing</em>. After doing <em>the daily thing</em> on the web for over 20 years, it was time for a change. 
</p> 
<p>
As I said over at the <a href="https://iwebthings.joejenett.com/notes-from-the-hub-04-10-23/">hub</a> back then, “I’m getting a little too old to keep up with the ‘daily’ part of its name.” I wanted to continue doing what I truly love to do on the web without that daily pressure to <em>make the donuts</em>. I like to think my donuts are tasty enough to enjoy even if they weren't available <strong>every</strong> day.
</p>
<p>
So I created <a href="https://dwt-archives.joejenett.com/"><em>the dailywebthing archives</em></a> and have been posting new links at the <a href="https://iwebthings.joejenett.com/">i.webthings hub</a> every 2-3 days. The old feeds from the <em>linkport</em> and <em>pointers</em>  redirect to the <em>i.webthings</em> feed.
</p>
<p>
The upside of this major change is I’m a happier camper now. I’m sharing almost as many links per week as I was before while having more time for other ongoing creative projects. Most important, I now enjoy a better balance between the <em>webthings</em> and <em>non-web things</em> in my life. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>But...</strong>
</p>
<p>I’ve made a number of changes to my web presence over the years, many very recently, and the last thing I want to do is to be a royal pain to those who most enjoy what I’m doing out here, those who have so generously paid attention to my efforts.  
</p>
<p>
RSS is a big part of what I do and I understand firsthand what it means put up with things like <a href="https://www.unseensounds.com/weblog/posts/2023/2023-05-29-constant-change.html">feed changes</a>. Yes, it can be a pain. That’s one of the downsides of change. Hopefully, the upside makes the change worth it. 
</p>
Finally, I must respond to something <a href="https://www.unseensounds.com/notes/2023/06/24/networking-with-mentions.html">Poorchop said</a> recently:
<blockquote><p>I would wager that most of the very few people who know about this website only found out about it after receiving a mention from me. </p></blockquote>
<p>I know the feeling buddy and I’m glad to know ya!</p>
