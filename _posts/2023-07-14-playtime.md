<h2>make something...</h2>
<p> I’m like a kid in a candy shop, exploring stuff created and accumulated over the years, reminded where I come from and better understanding where I am now.
</p>
<p>
The old becomes new again, awoken from its long, deep sleep.
</p>
<p>
Color me inspired. I need to make something new!
</p>
<h2>...like a better world</h2>
<p>
I’ve given up on the idea of saving the world. I’d rather do something small to make the world a little better. The thought of bringing out a little of your playful spirit is more than enough for me. You know... that feeling of just playing with imagery and color to pass the time - the feeling of freedom to just fuck around. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we can make something together.
