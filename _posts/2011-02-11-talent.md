  <p>"You should do something with that talent."</p>
  <p>I wanted to explain that I <i>am</i> doing something with it but it dawned on me I would probably be misunderstood.</p>

  <p>That's nice but I'm thinking to myself that I'm doing it for how it makes me feel. Besides, I already have a job so I don't really need to sell it.</p>
  <p>"I don't get it. Why do it if you can't get paid to do it? What's the point?"</p>
