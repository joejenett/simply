The fix was in and even the worst kind of leader was able to walk away unaccountable. He became emboldened by the result of the Senate Impeachment Trial in January. Those with a pulse had to have wondered what would come next in the shitshow of the century. Even if you’re in the so-called base and enjoy all the red meat, you still have to admit the shitshow is real. Come on now - don’t you?

## oh oh, we need a leader

I never experienced anything like the coronavirus pandemic. I could never even imagine such a horrific tragedy. So much death and millions of people losing their livelihoods in the firestorm. We need real leadership, which unfortunately seems to be nonexistent in this moment.

You’ve seen it with your own eyes. It’s no time for division but our so-called leader sees division as priority one. As sickening as that is, people can choose to respect expertise and ignore the prick in the White House. That works for me at least.

I want real information, not alternative facts. Truth is, our stable genius leader isn’t smart enough to even imagine what might be appropriate. It’s tough enough for all of us without having to deal with such political crap. Safety needs to be priority one. The shitshow is real. Without leadership, we’re left to handle this mess on our own. Especially because so many people have chosen to drink the lemonade of a conman.
