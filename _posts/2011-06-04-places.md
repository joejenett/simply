excerpt: |
  It might be the oceanside where even if the weather isn't ideal on the day of your visit, you still rekindle that place in your heart where all is intact and life flows. Or it might just be a song lyric that brings your life back into focus. Sometimes, just taking time to breathe and imagining one is in a different place, if only for a moment, can help restore one's inner peace and sense of well-being. Whatever it is that works, we all need to take the time to go there occasionally.
