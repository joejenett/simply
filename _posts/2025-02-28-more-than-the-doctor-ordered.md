The meds I do every morning to manage my little collection of physical ailments don’t always do it for me. Sometimes, the pain goes far beyond what a few Tylenol (along with those other meds) can resolve. When I wake up feeling like total shit, I need something more powerful. Well, I tried something this morning after my usual meds and motherfucker, it worked!

Clive’s guitar playing reminds me a bit of David Gilmour, which led me to my second musical med, Pink Floyd’s <em>Comfortably Numb</em>....

Then the third musical med smoothed it all out - <em>Rich Woman</em> by Robert Plant and Allison Krause with T-Bone Burnett on the guitar.

In the words of Mr. James Brown, <strong><em>I feel good!</em></strong><br>Thanks to the miracles of modern musical medicine.
