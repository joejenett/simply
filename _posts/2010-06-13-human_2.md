  Sometimes I think I'm just a prisoner of regret. Sometimes I think I'm lost.
  Everyone knows the feeling. And as the song says, everybody hurts. I'm not alone and I'm not unique. I'm just a human.

Sometimes I think I’m just a prisoner of regret. Sometimes I think I’m lost. Everyone knows the feeling. And as the song says, everybody hurts. I’m not alone and I’m not unique. I’m just a human.
