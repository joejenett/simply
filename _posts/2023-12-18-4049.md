A huge* tree out back at the edge of the yard just went down. It could have done some damage had it fallen in the direction of the house. Instead, it fell to the side in a neat path, just missing the patio, security light, and back corner of the house. Just call us the lucky jenetts...

Update 12/19/23:<br>
* Not exactly <em>huge</em> - itâ€™s no more than a 12" diameter and no longer than 60' - but this little guy made a <em>huge</em> thump when it hit the ground... ðŸ˜Ž
