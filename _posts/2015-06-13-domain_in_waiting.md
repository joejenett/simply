Year before last, a word came into my mind. A little glimpse into one’s life in just a few words might result in the reader imagining a much bigger story. I think I’ve always written like that, hoping the reader would think further about what I’ve said and maybe, even figure out exactly what I had in mind when I wrote the words. Call me silly, but I like being mysterious and the thought of creating a project around that fact is intriguing to me. Anyway, I needed a word for it and came up with _glimpstory_. I’m still working out how I might proceed but for now, here’s an example: 

“I was supposed to be a pharmacist. If being a doctor or a lawyer didn’t appeal to me, I could at least consider being a pharmacist. That was all she asked.”
