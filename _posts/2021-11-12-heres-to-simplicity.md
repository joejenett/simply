<p>To borrow a phrase from <a href="https://blogroll.org/keeping-it-simple/" title="Keeping it simple - Blogroll.org">Ray</a>, I’ve been working hard to “simplify the mission” around here too.  The first stage of my simplification project started about 6 months ago - it’s almost done.</p>

<p>Ray was talking about his sensible simplification of <a href="https://blogroll.org/" title="Ye Olde Blogroll">Blogroll.org</a>. The change not only helped bring back the fun for him - it also improved the user experience. I like it!</p>

<p>His story reminds me of my own need to simplify. Too many domains, too many Wordpress installations, and too many things to keep updated. Like Ray, I thought this was supposed to be fun. I’ve been doing this web thing for 24 years now and due to simplifying, I’m pleased to say it’s even more fun now. </p>

<p>I’ll spare you the details of the project. But if you explore <a href="#aka">my web</a> a bit, you’ll probably get it. Like Ray said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ahhhh… I can breathe easier and I don’t feel pressure anymore to keep so many things updated.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that’s why this blog is now <strong>simply.</strong></p>
