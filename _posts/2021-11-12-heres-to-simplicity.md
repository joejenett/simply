<p>To borrow a phrase from <a title="link no longer available">Ray</a>, I’ve been working hard to “simplify the mission” around here too.  The first stage of my simplification project started about 6 months ago - it’s almost done.</p>

<p>Ray was talking about his sensible simplification of <a href="https://blogroll.org/" title="Ye Olde Blogroll">Blogroll.org</a>. The change not only helped bring back the fun for him - it also improved the user experience. I like it!</p>

<p>His story reminds me of my own need to simplify. Too many domains, too many Wordpress installations, and too many things to keep updated. Like Ray, I thought this was supposed to be fun. I’ve been doing this web thing for 24 years now and due to simplifying, I’m pleased to say it’s even more fun now. </p>

<p>I’ll spare you the details of the project. But if you explore <a href="#aka">my web</a> a bit, you’ll probably get it. Like Ray said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ahhhh… I can breathe easier and I don’t feel pressure anymore to keep so many things updated.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that’s why this blog is now <strong>simply.</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:.8em;">Thanks for the kind mention, Joe! I love the name you've given your blog - simply. Perfect.
</p>
<p style="font-size:.8em;">Your post reminded me I need to apply "simply" to my personal blog too when I find the time; it's gotten a bit bloated there too.
</p>
<p style="font-size:.8em;">Take care.<br>
Ray

<p style="font-size:.8em;">Thank you for inspiring me to write about about my project Ray. This blog is just one of a number of sites which were either migrated from Wordpress to static sites, and/or moved into subdomains of jenett.org for the sake of more permanent archives (without owning so many domains). It was worth every minute of the work.
</p>
<p style="font-size:.8em;">As a result, I’m more focused on regularly updating the dailywebthing linkport and daily pointers and not worrying so much about the other active sites ('cause there's less of 'em). Simplifying is a good route to better enjoying what I do (and getting more done). Yay!
</p>
<p style="font-size:.8em;">You take care too...
</p>
