		When financial goals are no longer the center of our existence, time expands. We begin to see life for what it really is: a collection of simple, beautiful moments. A slow morning with a warm cup of tea, a walk through a forest as the sun filters through the trees, or the satisfaction of growing your own food, these moments offer something money can’t buy: peace.
