<p><a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/">John</a> wrote about a <a href="https://johnjohnston.info/blog/ios-cutout/">cool new feature</a> in iOS 16 which I really appreciated - it was the first I’ve heard about it. I had some fun playing with it on my iPhone. Could be an excellent creative tool and like John, I’m hoping it becomes part of iPadOS too.</p>

<p>Thanks John! </p>
