  <p>Having experienced and observed the last 50 years of politics I can’t count the times I’d been taken back by the absurd words and actions of both politicians and political wannabes. So many times I thought I’d seen it all. Now, here we are in 2016 and I can finally say it’s true. </p><p>
  It’s been like being trapped in a movie theatre watching a movie I can’t stand that seems like it will never end. All I can say now is <i>please vote</i> — you just might be the one who saves the sanity. And enjoy the fact that it’s over. </p>

Having experienced and observed the last 50 years of politics I can’t count the times I’d been taken back by the absurd words and actions of both politicians and political wannabes. So many times I thought I’d seen it all. Now, here we are in 2016 and I can finally say it’s true. 

It’s been like being trapped in a movie theatre watching a movie I can’t stand that seems like it will never end. All I can say now is _please vote_ — you just might be the one who saves the sanity. And enjoy the fact that it’s over.
