  <a href="https://micro.blog/JohnPhilpin">@JohnPhilpin</a> - I've been looking at your blog and remembered that problem you mentioned with the CC image a while back. I have a possible solution (which worked for me) - the following change to your style.css seemed to do the trick (removing the 'width' definition):
  <blockquote><pre>img {
  /*width: 100%;*/
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  border-radius: 5px;
  }</pre></blockquote>
  Fingers crossed that it helps...
