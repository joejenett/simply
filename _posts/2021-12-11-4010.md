summary: hot air balloons in a green field of grass

<p>(Updated 01/20/22)</p>

<p style="text-decoration:line-through;">I really like <a title="‘dream’ (app.wombo.art)" href="https://app.wombo.art/">‘dream’ (app.wombo.art)</a> - here’s what it generated after giving it the prompt, “hot air balloons in a green field of grass” - so cool!</p>
<p>Sorry, but I would never have linked to the site had I known it would be adding ecommerce and NFT-related content. Nothing wrong with all that except that it’s not the type of site I enjoy sharing. Yes, the picture is cool, so I’ll leave the link on it, but color me a bit disappointed. Oh well. </p>
