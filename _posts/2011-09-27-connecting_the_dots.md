  <p>There was a time when we visited each other's homes and enjoyed interesting conversations and other meaningful interaction.  There were no ads on the walls nor promoters shouting around us. We enjoyed each other's company and what we shared remained in memory for much longer than a few fleeting moments. We paid attention to each other then and the spirit of genuine personal expression seemed like magic.

[It’s the end of the web as we know it](http://adrianshort.co.uk/2011/09/25/its-the-end-of-the-web-as-we-know-it/)

> You can do what you like on your own website but you’ll probably be shouting into the void. 

I don’t care for the author’s allusion to _class_, but some excellent points are made.
