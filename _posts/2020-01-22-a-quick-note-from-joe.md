Hello friends. I’m just checking in to shed some light on why this kinda thriving daily curation habit of mine came to an abrupt halt recently. The good news is I’m here and particularly thankful to be able to say that.

I became ill a week ago today and though I was unable to function (literally), scheduled posts continued to auto publish to the dailywebthing linkport (through the 21st) and daily pointers (through the 18th). I’m still on the mend and hope to be back in the swing of things soon. For now, it’s baby steps while I’m still recuperating and since feeling better is my key priority, chances are it’ll all take some time.

But please, do stay tuned because this is what I love to do and I ain’t dead yet. Love ya!
